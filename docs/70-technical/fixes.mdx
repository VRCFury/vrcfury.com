# Automatic Fixes

When a VRCFury component or prop is placed anywhere on an avatar, several fixes are activated by default. These fixes are applied
to resolve common VRChat and Unity bugs that we have deemed safe to apply in all scenarios.

* VRChat does not support Animator Override Controllers
  * VRCFury automatically flattens Animator Override Controllers on your descriptor, making them compatible with VRChat.
* Transition times for muscle animations are ignored by unity when placed on layer 0 of an animator
  * VRCFury inserts an empty base layer when this issue is detected
* The VRC avatar descriptor is corrupted and includes two FX layers when you change the avatar rig to generic and back to humanoid
  * VRCFury corrects this issue by keeping the proper FX controller and replacing the other with the missing Action layer
* Assets that were used in an animator previously, but the layer was deleted, are still included in the upload bundle
  * VRCFury corrects this by walking all controllers and building a new copy containing only the layers and states that are actually used
* Controller layers that are empty still take processing time in game
  * VRCFury automatically removes layers that are guaranteed to be empty and have no side-effects
* Animations that target invalid objects still take processing time
  * VRCFury automatically removes animation properties that are guaranteed to be invalid (targeting an object that does not exist)
* States in an additive layer marked as WD off can cause blendshape values to multiply by 3x, and cause unrelated transforms to move continuously
  * VRCFury removes the additive controller that VRChat adds by default (unused by virtually everyone)
  * VRCFury automatically marks all additive states as WD on (only if you opt into Fix Write Defaults)
* States marked as WD off containing a direct blendtree can cause unrelated animations in the controller to break
  * VRCFury automatically marks all direct blendtrees as WD on (only if you opt into Fix Write Defaults)
* The VRCSDK fails with a cryptic error message when menu icons are too large
  * VRCFury detects this condition and shows a useful error message with the icon paths
* VRChat throws away parameters in game if there are more than 256 unique params, even if they are not network synced
  * VRCFury detects this condition and shows a useful error message
* VRChat throws away contacts in game if you have more than 256 total
  * VRCFury detects this condition and shows a useful error message
* VRChat IK and OSC will crash if you have two parameters with the same name, except one has underscores where the other has spaces
  * VRCFury automatically renames parameters conflicting in this way
* VRChat IK and OSC will crash if you have a parameter containing the text `[]`
  * VRCFury automatically renames parameters conflicting in this way
* Controller states and blendtree children with a "None" (missing) animation can break transforms and other animations in avatars using WD off
  * VRCFury automatically replaces missing animations with an empty 1-second clip in these scenarios
* Unity "claims" transforms and muscles for the lowest controller that has them unmasked, even if they are not actively being animated
  * This is a common issue between an avatar's Gesture and FX layers, because when users have no mask in FX, it "claims" all transforms,
    breaking any transforms that are attempted in Gesture.
  * VRCFury solves this issue by moving all non-muscle animations from Gesture into the top of FX, ensuring they continue working as they did previously.
  * Applying a mask to all FX layers (as recommended in other guides) is not a foolproof solution, as masking layers is impossible in some
    scenarios ([read more about it here](/technical/wd#broken-properties-in-masked-layers)).
* Using WD off in a controller state that is placed in a layer at or below a state with WD on causes unity to break all animations in the controller
  * VRCFury detects this scenario and offers the option to solve it automatically by aligning the WD of each setting.
  * Additive layers and direct blendtrees are excluded from this rule, and must always be WD on (as described above).
* MMD worlds do not work properly for avatars using WD off, disable the Gesture controller, and (in some songs) disable FX layer 1 and 2
  * VRCFury automatically resolves all of these issues (only if you opt into VRCFury MMD Compatibility)
* When you delete an int controller parameter and recreate it as a bool, all controller transitions using that parameter will say "True", even though internally they are broken and will never transition.
  * VRCFury automatically corrects these transitions to work if the bool is true, as indicated by the editor.
* When you delete or change the type of a parameter, but have conditions expecting the old type, attempting to use the controller will cause unity to abort the controller entirely, breaking the avatar in the editor and in game
  * VRCFury automatically removes these transitions, as they are never valid
* When you delete a float parameter and recreate it as an int, unity will internally respect the old float thresholds even though the editor displays them as floored
  * VRCFury automatically updates the internal thresholds to reflect the value displayed in the editor
* If one of the controllers on the avatar descriptor is set to "None", unity animation states temporarily reset in between frames, causing Audio Sources to restart every frame
  * VRCFury automatically replaces "None" controllers with an empty replacement
* Non-mobile materials are still included in the quest upload bundle if they are used in animations
  * VRCFury automatically removes all non-mobile materials from quest builds to ensure they are not included in the upload
* VRChat ignores Animator Tracking Control behaviors that run too soon after the avatar is loaded
  * VRCFury buffers all tracking control changes and repeats them several times as the avatar is loaded
* Animator Tracking Control behaviors from various unrelated plugins can break MMD dances
  * VRCFury buffers all tracking control changes and triggers them only once the avatar is not in an MMD station
* The VRCSDK incorrectly applies android validations while in windows mode if you select the android tab in the inspector of a texture asset
  * VRCFury automatically syncs this setting back to the proper value when the vrcsdk dialog loads and when a build begins
* VRCFury removes the built-in unity "Toggle", "Dropdown" and "Toggle Group" components from the Add Component menu, as they are not usable
  during avatar creation, and cause confusion when creating an avatar Toggle.
* AudioLink in the editor does not automatically attach to newly-created renderers after entering play mode.
  * VRCFury reinitializes all AudioLink components in the scene after an avatar's preprocessor hooks have run.
* Av3Emualator throws errors and breaks if an animator in the scene disappears or has its controller changes after play mode has begun
  * VRCFury reinitializes Av3Emu after an avatar's preprocessor hooks have run
* Importing Poiyomi or the VRCSDK from an avatar package when they are already installed breaks the project for users who do not know to exclude them from the import
  * VRCFury prevents Poiyomi or VRCSDK asset files from being imported if they are already detected in the project.
* Poiyomi locks down all materials when preprocessor hooks are run in play mode in versions before 9
  * VRCFury patches Poiyomi's LockMaterialsOnUpload to never apply while in play mode.
* VRCSDK contacts do not properly distinguish between "Self" and "Others" when testing in editor play mode
  * VRCFury automatically adjusts the playerId on avatar contacts in play mode to make "Self" and "Others" work properly.
* Unity does not properly apply changes from nested prefabs when those changes are made externally (for example, using version management) until the outer prefab is reimported
  * VRCFury automatically recursively triggers unity to reimport prefabs in inside-out order prior to loading their vrcfury components
* Users accidentally hide console errors and then complain that there are no script errors when checking
  * VRCFury ensures the Error logging level is enabled in the unity console whenever scripts are reloaded
* Users accidentally go into pause mode forever and then complain that Gesture Manager does not work properly
  * VRCFury ensures pause mode and "Error Pause" are both disabled when scripts are reloaded
* Avatars with WD on will incorrectly always select the default value of material properties from the first material slot, even if that material doesn't have the property.
  * Strangely, this issue only happens in-game and is not reproducible in the editor
  * VRCFury resolves this issue by detecting these cases and forcefully records the default state in a top defaults layer, even if WD is on.
* Many avatars upload with VRC's default Action controller, even though it's impossible to trigger any of the dances due to a customized menu.
  * VRCFury automatically removes the default VRC action controller if the menu on the avatar descriptor does not use VRCEmote.
