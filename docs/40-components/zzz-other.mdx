# Other Components

## Advanced Visemes

This component allows you to use VRCFury actions as visemes.

Benefits:

* Use Animation Clips, Flipbooks, or any other VRCFury action as a speech viseme.
* You can use bone transforms in your visemes, meaning you can open your jaw rather than using an "open mouth" Blendshape.
* This can enhance some features, such as tongue movement, while your mouth is open during speech.

Downsides:

* Advanced Visemes are created using a simplified estimation of VRChat's visemes.
* They may appear more "jerky" or "robotic."
* If you are attaching an item directly to the face, where perfect sync with the face mesh is important, your only real option is to either merge the meshes in blender, or live with jerky visemes and use Advanced Visemes for both the base mesh and the addon (disabling visemes in the VRC avatar descriptor entirely).
* If you want Advanced Visemes to work better, vote for [this VRChat feature request](https://feedback.vrchat.com/feature-requests/p/provide-individual-viseme-levels-as-avatar-float-parameters).

## Anchor Override Fix 

Adding this component ensures that all of your avatar meshes use the same anchor override, which ensures
different meshes receive the same environment lighting level.

## Apply During Upload

This component can apply any [action](/actions) on your avatar during the upload/build process. Useful if you want to show a property like a blendshape on your avatar in the editor but have it "off" when uploading.

## Blendshape Link

Add this component, specify a clothing mesh, and a path to the Body object on the avatar, and the blendshapes
from the clothing will automatically be linked to the avatar body. This means any sliders / toggles affecting
the body will be reflected in the clothing as well automatically.

## Blendshape Optimizer

Automatically bakes all non-animated blendshapes into your avatar's meshes. Reduces your VRAM usage for free, no configuration required!

## Blink Controller

Include a single-frame animation of your avatar with its eyes closed (or click the plus and give it the blend shape name), and VRCFury will drive your avatar's blink cycle.

Benefits:
* Blinking will stop automatically when your avatar performs VRCFury gestures affecting its eyes. This means no more 'double-blinking'.
* Unlike VRChat's built-in eye tracking disable feature, your eyes will not freeze closed, partially closed, unfreeze unexpectedly due to combo-gestures.
* Your eye blink will be synchronized with all other clients (I'm unsure if the default vrc eye blink is synced or not).

## Bounding Box Fix

This component ensures that every mesh on your avatar has a suitably large bounding box. This prevents the issue when some objects on your avatar dissappear when viewed at extreme angles.

## Cross-Eye Fix

VRChat introduces roll to your eye bones in some circumstances, making it appear that you've gone cross-eyed.
Adding this fix will solve this problem automatically through a combination of rotation constraints to eliminate roll.

## Delete During Upload

Deletes the entire object, and all children of the object it is added to during the upload/build process. No other VRCFury components stored within will be processed.

## Direct Tree Optimizer

If you add this component to your avatar, VRCFury will attempt to convert all non-conflicting animator layers on your avatar into a single
direct blend tree layer. This reduces the number of animator layers on your avatar, which can result in a significant improvement on performance
(frametime) of your avatar. Various VRCFury components that add animator logic like Toggles, Gestures, Full Controllers, SPS or Advances Visemes will automatically have this optimization applied.

## Droppable (World Constraint)

This component will allow you to 'drop' the object it is added to in the world, whenever you enable the toggle added in your menu.

## Fix Write Defaults

This component will automatically align Write Defaults for every state on your avatar. It will automatically prefer whichever your avatar is "closest to," meaning it will select On or Off depending on which requires the fewest changes to your avatar. If you'd like, you can override the selection and Force Off or Force On. Yes, it's magic.

## Gizmo

All this does is show an editor gizmo. It does nothing in game. Useful primarily for prop artists
who wish to identify something on their prop without including it in the upload.

## MMD Compatibility

This component will improve MMD compatibility for your avatar, by maintaining MMD blendshapes when using a [Blendshape Optimizer](/components/other#blendshape-optimizer), avoiding usage of layers that MMD worlds are known to interfere with, and disabling hand animations when MMD dances are active.
Under advanced options, you can define additional animator layers that are to be disabled, or a global bool that is to be set to true when MMD is detected.

## Move Menu Item

Can move a menu item like a toggle or submenu, either already on the avatar, or one created by VRCFury. Simply enter the path you'd like to move from and move to. For example:

* From Path: `My Folder/Clothing/Shirt`
* To Path: `Cool Stuff/Clothes/Shirt`

Leaving the `To Path` field blank will delete the menu item.

## Override Menu Icon

Will override the icon for the given item and path in your menu.

## Override Menu Settings

Allows you to change VRCFury's default "Next" menu item, when there are too many items to fit on a page.

## Parameter Compressor (Beta)

This component will optimize all synced menu-controlled Float and Int parameters into 16 total synced bits.

Non menu-controlled parameters and parameters used in two/four axis puppets are not optimized as they might be driven by OSC for features like face tracking or used for puppeting things like tails, ears or other avatar features.
This is to ensure real-time sync for those use cases.

## Remove Hand Gestures

When present, this component eliminates any features in your avatar's non-VRCFury controllers that use hand gestures. This is useful if you'd like to implement your own hand gestures with VRCFury, don't want them to conflict with ones that came with a base avatar, and don't want to edit them manually.

## Security Pin Number

This component will add a `Security` submenu in your avatar's menu. Until the correct pin number is entered:
* All objects with a [VRCFury | Security Restricted](/components/other#security-restricted) component will be disabled.
* All VRCFury Toggles marked with the `Security` flag will be forced Off.

The pin number can be between 4 and 10 digits long, only numbers between 1-7 can be used.

## Security Restricted

Any object this component is placed on will be forcefully disabled until a Security Pin is entered is entered in your avatar's menu.
:::note
You MUST have a [VRCFury | Security Pin Number](/components/other#security-pin-number) component on your avatar's root with a pin number set, or this will not do anything!

## Senky Gesture Driver

This component sets up gestures the way that Senky likes them! Probably not super useful for you, unless you want this very specific gesture hand layout.

## Show In First Person

This component uses constraints to always show the object that it is placed on and its children in the first person view of the avatar wearer. It cannot be combined with Armature Link and will effectively parent the object it is placed on to the Head.

## Toes Puppet

Given an action for down, up and splay, this creates a puppet for toe control in your menu.

## When-Talking State

This is a very simple component which activates the given action(s) only while the user is "talking" (with any viseme).
