# Armature Link

> Attach clothing, props, etc to bones on the avatar

Is your prop a skinned mesh that "attaches" to the bones of the root avatar? Armature Link is what you need! Give it the root bone (hips) within your prop and the path to that same root bone in the avatar, and VRCFury will automatically attach the mesh to the avatar's bones. Just make sure the bones you want to link are all in the same order and have the same names.

You can also use this component to attach an object to an avatar's bone. For instance, if your prop contains a
empty that must be on the avatar's hand, you can use Armature Link to place it there.

Animating an Armature Linked object? No problem! Armature Link will automatically rewrite any animation clips pointing to the original path of the object to the new path after it is moved.

## Advanced Options

### Search and Matching

#### Recursive
If checked, armature link will recursively link all matching child objects which have a matching-named object on the avatar.

#### Remove bone suffix/prefix

If set, this substring will be removed from all bone names in the prop. This is useful for props where the artist added something like _PropName to the end of every bone, breaking Armature Link in the process. If empty, the suffix will be predicted based on the difference between the name of the given root bones.
In nearly all cases, this should be left empty.

### Transform Alignment

These settings allow you to choose if the object should be snapped to the target object's position/rotation/scale, or if it should remain where it was originally placed.

## Debug info
This will display where the prop will be merged, what Link Mode will be used and if Bone Offsets will be kept.\
If there are any prop bones that Armature Link did not find an match for in the avatar's armature, they will also be displayed in Debug Info. These bones will be added as new children. In most cases these are bones like Skirt bones, Strings, Straps
